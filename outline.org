* Cleaning up your superfund site
** Hi I'm ashton, I'm here to talk about cleaning up your superfund site
** Spoiler alert
*** This title of this talk described a problem, this presentation is about a solution.
**** Solves the problem that is the title
**** Solves many other problems as well
** Goals
*** Minimize un-version-controlled dependencies
*** Testability
**** Unit testing service
**** Integration testing service
*** Approachability
**** Elapsed onboarding time
*** Deployability
**** CI/CD
**** The amount of time that it would take a new developer to run your app locally
**** You cannot implement CI without a reproducable environment
** Problems
*** Environmental dependencies in a README
** Seperation of concerns
*** Goals
    What I want to talk about is divorcing the application that you're writing from the
    external dependencies that it relies upon.  Ideally you want to be able to check out
    and develop on a given application without spending much (if all) time setting up the
    local environment to be able to run that application.
*** Concentric circles
    You can think of your application as a kernel of code in the middle of several concentric
    circles, like invisible matryoshka dolls around you, but not creepy.
**** Kernel: your app
*** detail
**** First ring: your package mananger
*** detail
**** Seconsd ring: your Virtual machine (dockerfile in this example)
*** detail
**** Third ring: your service collection (docker-compose in this example)
*** detail

** The power of containers
*** Repoducability
*** Maintainability
*** Version control
**** Incident resolution
*** DONE Setup time / onboarding
*** Decreasing congnitive load
